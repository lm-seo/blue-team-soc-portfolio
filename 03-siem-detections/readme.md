# SIEM Detections – Blue Team Cases

This section documents hands-on SIEM detection and investigation cases based on real-world scenarios from the Let'sDefend monitoring platform.

The goal of these write-ups is to demonstrate a practical SOC analyst workflow: alert triage, investigation, hypothesis validation, and incident-driven decision making using SIEM data.

## Platform
- Let'sDefend – Monitoring & Detection Lab
- Simulated enterprise environment with real-world attack scenarios

## What You Will Find Here
Each detection case focuses on:
- Understanding the detection logic behind the SIEM rule
- Analyzing alerts and associated telemetry
- Identifying attacker behavior and attack stages
- Validating or dismissing alerts based on evidence
- Extracting relevant Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

## Skills Demonstrated
- SIEM alert triage and prioritization
- Log analysis (authentication, process, network, email)
- Detection engineering mindset
- Mapping activity to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- Incident analysis and documentation

## Case Structure
Each detection is documented in its own directory and includes:
- Detection context and rule description
- Investigation steps and queries
- Evidence analysis
- Findings and conclusions

## Disclaimer
All cases are performed in a controlled lab environment for educational purposes only.
