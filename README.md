# 🛡️ Blue Team / SOC Analyst Portfolio

This repository showcases my practical skills as a SOC Analyst L1, including incident investigations, SIEM detections, home lab engineering, forensics, and network analysis.
All the work here is based on realistic scenarios built in my own defensive home lab using Splunk, Wazuh, pfSense, Windows & Linux endpoints, and attacker simulations.

## CTFs Accounts:

## 🔍  What You Will Find Here
### 1. Home Lab Architecture

A full defensive environment designed to simulate real SOC operations:

- pfSense firewall
- Wazuh SIEM + agents
- Splunk instance for log correlation
- Windows Server + Windows 10 endpoints
- Kali Linux attacker machine
- Zeek traffic analysis
