## My profile in CTFs Platforms:

This directory contains my Blue Team writeups and practical investigations across multiple defensive security platforms. The focus is on SOC analyst workflows, including detection, analysis, incident response, and evidence-driven conclusions. Each writeup reflects hands-on work with real-world scenarios and documents the methodology, tools, findings, and lessons learned.

Platforms included: CyberDefenders, Blue Team Labs Online (BTLO), Hack The Box (Blue Team / SOC), and other defensive security training environments used as part of my continuous Blue Team skill development.
